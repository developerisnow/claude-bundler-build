<repositories_file_organization>
1. I'm collecting repositories in a single directory.
2.I'm using the following structure:
.~/__Repositories/
└── {prefix1}-{sub-prefix2-if-relevant}-{repository-githubUrl}__{github-repository-ownerName}.
3. I try to stick to the current order—if there are exceptions, they are very rare, and I will report them separately.
4. Oh yes, there are situations when I do {monorepo}/repositories/{symlink-folders-repositories} just FIY.
