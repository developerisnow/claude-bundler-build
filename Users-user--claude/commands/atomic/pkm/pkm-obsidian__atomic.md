## Article Backup
- Always save the full article content as a markdown file in the `_Outputs_External` folder.
- Use the filename format: `{YYYYMMDD}-{title}.md` (date = published or backup date).

## Atomic Summary Section
- At the top of the note, add a concise, ADHD-friendly summary section.
- Use emoji, numbers, lists, and a cheatsheet table for clarity.
- The summary heading must include a timestamp `{YYYYMMDD-hhmm}`.

## Obsidian Link
- At the end of the note, add an Obsidian-style link: `[[{title}]]`.

## Workflow Consistency
- Always follow this sequence: backup → summary → obsidian link.
- Never skip any step, even if the article is short.

## File Management
- If a file with the same name exists, append a new summary with a new timestamp at the top.
- Ensure no duplicate Obsidian links at the end of the file.

## Metadata
- If available, include metadata (source URL, author, tags) in the YAML frontmatter.
