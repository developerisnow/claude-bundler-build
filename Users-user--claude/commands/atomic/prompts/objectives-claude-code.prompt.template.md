I use transcription voice to text with possible mistakes and errors but with context you should be able to understand what I say and what I mean.
It could be variative with my ADHD/AuDHD brain and jump between high level `core ideas, concepts and high level goals/ideas` and middle/low level `details, depths, examples`, it could consist of some `deviation` but keep the line and after analysing this please make good organized from TOP to DOWN all objectives, tasks and todo, well organized with checklist and segmented by sections focused on pragmatic realization without overthinking, always try to catch core.
